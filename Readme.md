# Classification of customers using K-means Clustering

## Objective

The mall wants to target customers using marketing campaign and identify the population that could benefit from this marketing.

## Dataset

Consists 200 records with age, income and spending score

## Steps

* Importing data

* Fitting data to k means algorithm

* Finding the optimal number of cluster value using elbow method

* Training k means using the optimal number of clusters 

* Visualizing the population data points using k  means

## Supporting files

* Elbow Curve - shows the optimal number of clusters required
* Customer Categorized - shows the classified customer regions

## Conclusion

The program is able to identify the population based on spending and other details. Now the mall can target the group it is interested into.
